# synapis_recruitmen_challenge

In this repository, it makes 3 tasks received for recruitment.

##The first 

task required returning 32-bit intiger (signed) in inverted form, the code to invert the given number can be found in the file task_1.py

*Input*: -32

*Output*: -423
## The second 
task was to generate a combination of letters located under the digits in the phone keyboard (file: task_2) eg. 

*Input*: digits = "46" # where { [...] '4': "ghi" [...] '6': "mno" [...]}

*Output*: ["gm", "gn", "go", "hm", "hn", "ho", "im", "in", "io"]

## The third  

task was a bit more complicated, involving justifying the text. Justification is to cut the text and increase the gaps between words so that paragraphs have the expected length (variable maximum_width ). When processing the text, words cannot be cut off, and the last paragraph is to be left-aligned with no extra spaces. Spaces between words should be evenly spaced starting from the left, and should not be at the beginning or end of a paragraph. 

*Input*: words = "Hey there mate, it’s nice to finally meet you!",
maximum_width = 16

*Output*:
[
    "Hey there mate,"
    "it’s nice to",
    "finally meet",
    "you."
]
